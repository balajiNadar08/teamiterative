    aboutDisease: "Disease examination and diagnosis in Ayurveda is a comprehensive systematic approach to identify health disorders. This process involves detailed analysis of the patient's constitution, lifestyle, symptoms, and environmental factors. Practitioners examine the balance of three doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) and assess the patient's digestive fire (Agni) and waste elimination (Mala). The diagnostic process includes pulse examination, observation of tongue, eyes, and physical appearance, along with questioning about symptoms and medical history. This holistic evaluation helps determine the root cause of illness rather than just treating symptoms, enabling personalized treatment plans.",

    aboutDisease: "Vikara represents any disturbance or deviation from the natural state of perfect health in Ayurvedic medicine. It encompasses all forms of physical, mental, and spiritual imbalances that manifest as diseases or disorders. This concept acknowledges that health is a dynamic state of equilibrium between mind, body, and consciousness. Vikara occurs when this balance is disrupted due to improper diet, lifestyle, emotional stress, environmental factors, or genetic predisposition. The condition can range from subtle functional disturbances to severe pathological changes. Understanding vikara helps in early detection and prevention of diseases through lifestyle modifications and therapeutic interventions.",

This imbalance is considered the root cause of all diseases in Ayurveda. When doshas become vitiated due to incompatible diet, improper lifestyle, stress, or environmental factors, they create pathological changes in the body.

Understanding these stages helps in early detection and appropriate intervention. In the accumulation stage, Vata begins to increase in its primary site.
